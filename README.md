Output_EEPROM is mostly taken from Ben Eater, only slightly modified

The writeEEPROM, readEEPROM, setAddress and printContents functions in both BIG_EEPROM_program and EEPROM_program are also taken from Ben Eater

Info:
Output_EEPROM is for the output unit
BIG_EEPROM_program is for the main control unit EEPROM chips (they hold instructions and permanant memory)
EEPROM_program is for the secondary EEPROM chips, they many serve to expand the number of output signals available
